# way-of-working Specification

## Purpose
How tabelline is made: specs with examples that run, pages kept up to date and a devlog built as
nimib notebooks, previews before merges.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Behaviour lives in the specs
Every agreed behaviour SHALL be a requirement with scenarios in `openspec/specs/`. New work SHALL
start as an OpenSpec change in `openspec/changes/` (proposal, spec deltas, tasks), be built in one
PR, and be archived when it ships. Ideas not yet picked up SHALL live in `BACKLOG.md`.

#### Scenario: An idea becomes work
- **WHEN** a backlog idea is picked up
- **THEN** it becomes a change, its backlog entry is marked in progress, and when the change is archived the entry is removed and CHANGELOG.md gets a line

### Requirement: Examples that run
A requirement that describes Nim API SHALL have an example: a ```nim block followed by a ```text
block with what it prints. `nim r tools/specexamples.nim` SHALL run every example of the specs in
one program and fail when an output differs; `--update` SHALL write the actual outputs back. CI
SHALL run them on every push and pull request.

#### Scenario: A change breaks an example
- **WHEN** a change to the code makes an example print something else
- **THEN** `tools/specexamples.nim` exits with an error showing the expected and the actual output

### Requirement: Pages are notebooks
Every page SHALL be a nimib notebook in `docs/` that writes a standalone HTML file, in the
quaderno theme (`docs/quaderno.nim`), with the code that made each table shown next to it. CI
SHALL build all pages (`docs/all.nim`) and deploy them to GitHub Pages from `main`; the HTML SHALL
NOT be committed.

### Requirement: Pages kept up to date, and a devlog
The site SHALL have pages kept up to date as tabelline changes (the Guide, the specs page and
the others on the home page), and a devlog of dated posts, each telling one step as it happened
and not updated afterwards. The home page SHALL list the pages in groups, by the question a reader
brings, with names a newcomer can read. The devlog index SHALL list only the posts, newest first,
read from the posts' sources. The specs page SHALL show every spec with its examples, their
output and the HTML table each example makes.

#### Scenario: A new post
- **WHEN** a post `docs/devlog/<slug>.nim` is added
- **THEN** it appears on the devlog index at the next build with nothing else to edit, and gets a line in the README

### Requirement: English, preview first
Specs, code, commits, PRs and the devlog SHALL be in English (Italian words are welcome as names).
A change SHALL be shown to Pietro as a published preview before it is merged, and nothing SHALL
go to `main` without his go.
